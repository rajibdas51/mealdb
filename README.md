# Recipe App

## Bug Fixes

### 1.Missing await in getRecipeDetails – Fixed to properly await the API response.

### 2.Redundant .then() in async function – Removed for cleaner async/await usage.

- **Location**: `HttpKit.js` – `getRecipeDetails` method

### 3.Incorrect Key in Recipe List – (Used recipe.id instead of recipe.idMeal, causing key warnings in React)

- Fixed by updating to key={recipe?.idMeal} .

### 4.searchInput was incorrectly updated as an object, though initialized as a string.

-Fixed by using setSearchInput(e.target.value) directly.
